# HousingListings

**Version 0.10**

Hello! Welcome to Corbans Housing Listings!

This app will showcase basic CRUD functions in the form of a fictional real estate company.
You will be able to view, edit, and post listings as well as associate those listings with one a company realtor.
I hope you have fun! This program was a lot of fun to make and I may add some features over time.

Cheers!
